This project aims to predict the Price of a Car by taking it's Company name, it's Model name, Year of Purchase, and other parameters.

Some packages used are:
 - numpy 
 - pandas 
 - scikit-learn

What this project does?

This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name,etc.,


## working ?

1. Data was scraped from this
link for data: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/CarPrice.csv)

2. The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.

3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it.

4. This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
